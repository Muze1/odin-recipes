            <ul>
                <li>1 quantity Danish pastry, chilled</li>
                <li>Flour for dusting</li>
                <li>1 quantity crème pâtissière</li>
                <li>225g raisins</li>
                <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>2 medium eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>150g apricot jam to glaze</li>
                <li>200g icing sugar</li>
                <li>2 tbsp water</li>
                <li>Finely grated zest of 1 lemon</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Line 3 or 4 baking trays with baking parchment or silicone paper.</li>
                <li>Cut the rested dough in half. Roll one half out on a lightly floured surface to a large rectangle, about 7mm thick. Turn it 90°, if necessary, so a long edge is facing you. Smear half the crème pâtissière over the dough, leaving a clear 5cm margin along the near edge. Sprinkle half the raisins and cinnamon over the crème. Roll the dough towards you into a sausage, keeping it as tight as possible – give a gentle tug each time you roll to tighten the dough and give it a little tension. When you reach the end, roll the sausage back and forth a few times to seal the join. Repeat with the second piece of dough and remaining ingredients.</li>
                <li>Cut the rolls into 3cm slices. Lay cut side up and apart on the baking trays and put each inside a clean plastic bag. Leave to rise at cool room temperature (18 – 24°C) until at least doubled in size, about 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Heat your oven to 200°C. Brush the risen pastries with beaten egg and bake for 15 – 20 minutes until golden brown. Meanwhile, warm the apricot jam with a little water in a pan, then sieve. As you take the pastries out of the oven, brush with the jam and transfer to a wire rack to cool. For the icing, stir the ingredients together until smooth. When the pastries are cooled, drizzle the lemon icing over them.</li>
