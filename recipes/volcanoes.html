            <h2>A mouth-melting experience!</h2>
                <p>This is my version of the classic chocolate fondant - but I like this name better. These little hot chocolate puddings really do remind me of volcanoes as they release their soft, silky river of chocolate. Achieving the molten centre is all about their timing. Don't let the puddings bake to the point that their surface begins to crack, as this means the centres are starting to cook..</p>
            
            <h2>Cook Time</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 12-14 minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Serves:</strong> 4</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>165g unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, plus extra for greasing</li>
                <li>165g dark chocolate, about 70% cocoa solids, chopped into small pieces</li>
                <li>3 medium eggs</li>
                <li>3 medium egg yolks</li>
                <li>85g caster sugar</li>
                <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
            </ul>
                <h3>Equipment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 individual pudding moulds or dariole moulds, 175ml capacity</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Grease 4 individual pudding moulds, about 175ml capacity, with a little butter.</li>
                <li>Put the butter and chocolate into a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering (ban marie). Remove the pan from the heat and leave to melt, stirring once or twice.</li>
                <li>Using an electric whisk, whisk the eggs, egg yolks and sugar together for several minutes until thick, pale and moussey.</li>
                <li>Carefully fold the chocolate mixture into the egg and sugar mix, using a spatula or large metal spoon. Sift in the flour and fold this in carefully too.</li>
                <li>Divide the chocolate mixture between the prepared moulds. Place in the fridge for at least 2 hours until firm. (You can make the pudding up to 24 hours in advance and leave them in the fridge until you are ready to cook and serve them).</li>
                <li>When you are ready to cook, heat the oven to 200Â°C/gas 6. Stand the moulds on a baking tray and bake for 12-14 minutes, or until the puddings are risen but not cracked.</li>
                <li>Turn the puddings out onto individual plates and serve at once, with pouring cream.</li>
            </ol>
