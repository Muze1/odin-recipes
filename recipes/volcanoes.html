                <p>This is my version of the classic chocolate fondant - but I like this name better. These little hot chocolate puddings really do remind me of volcanoes as they release their soft, silky river of chocolate. Achieving the molten centre is all about their timing. Don't let the puddings bake to the point that their surface begins to crack, as this means the centres are starting to cook..</p>
