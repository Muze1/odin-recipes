            <h2>What Is Bolo de Leite?</h2>
                <p>Bolo de leite is a traditional Brazilian cake that literally translates to
                "milk cake"â€”and for good reason. Milk is the main ingredient, and it is 
                what helps keep the cake moist and chewy.</p>
                <p>The basic recipe calls for just five ingredients that are typically
                found in any pantry (not just in Brazil). This cake is a quick go-to 
                if you want to enjoy something sweet after dinner or when someone decides 
                to pay you a visit with little to no warning.</p>
                <p>You can modify this cake according to your preference; 
                    optional add-ins are listed below the main recipe.</p><br />

            <h2>Cook Time</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 10 minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 1 hour</li>
                <li><strong>Serves:</strong> 6+ servings</li><br />
            </ul>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups flour</li>
                <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1/3 cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
            </ul>
                
                <h3>Optional Add-Ins</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chocolate chips:</strong> If you want your cake to have a hint of chocolate. 
                        Mini Reese's peanut butter cups are an add-on I love, but I only use add them 
                        when I'm in North America (they're way too expensive and hard to find in Brazil).</li>
                    <li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> Add it to enhance your cake's smell and to help make 
                        your house smell like a bakery!</li>
                    <li><strong>Coconut:</strong> Coconut is a good idea if a simple milk cake is a bit 
                        too boring for you. Some shredded coconut in the batter and some on top can easily 
                        transform this dessert into a coconut cake.</li>
                    <li><strong>Condensed milk/dulce de leche:</strong> Pour a bit on top of your 
                        'bolo de leite' to decorate it when it's done baking. Designs/words/images 
                        are also possible if you're artistic.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350F (180C).</li>
                <li>Combine all of the cake ingredients in a large mixing bowl.
                     Mix with an electric mixer until smooth.</li>
                <li>Add optional add-ins, if desired. Mix with a spoon.</li>
                <li>Grease a pan and pour the mixture into the pan. 
                    Sprinkle some add-ins on top, if desired.</li>
                <li>Bake for around 1 hour. Since this is a fairly moist cake, 
                    a toothpick won't really help you decide whether it's done or not.
                     It will harden as it cools, but 60 minutes of baking are usually enough. 
                     Let it cool before enjoying.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Baking Tips</h2>
                <p>For larger servings, you can double the recipe for all the ingredients - except the butter.
                    For the butter you'll have to play it by ear. If you double it, the cake will be too 
                    moist and may have many holes. I recommend around 1/2 cup butter if you're doubling the
                    other ingredients.
                </p>
                <p>The first few times I made this cake, the batter appeared to be too liquidy,
                     so I added extra flour. However, the batter for this cake is meant to be this 
                     way and there is nothing to worry about. If you follow the proportions I have 
                     suggested in the ingredients list, your bolo de leite will turn out just right
                      at the end of the recommended baking time.</p>
                <p>Feel free to check up on the cake during the baking process, but as I said, don't
                     worry if it appears to be too watery to be a cake. All will turn out well in the end. 
                     However, if it makes you feel better, an extra 1/4 cup of flour won't do any harm. 
                     Enjoy the cake!</p><br />
