            <h2>What Is Bolo de Leite?</h2>
                <p>Bolo de leite is a traditional Brazilian cake that literally translates to
                "milk cake"â€”and for good reason. Milk is the main ingredient, and it is 
                what helps keep the cake moist and chewy.</p>
                <p>The basic recipe calls for just five ingredients that are typically
                found in any pantry (not just in Brazil). This cake is a quick go-to 
                if you want to enjoy something sweet after dinner or when someone decides 
                to pay you a visit with little to no warning.</p>
                <p>You can modify this cake according to your preference; 
                    optional add-ins are listed below the main recipe.</p><br />

            <h2>Cook Time</h2>
                <ul><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 10 minutes</ul>
                <ul><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 1 hour</ul>
                <ul><strong>Ready In:</strong> 1 hour 10 minutes</ul>
                <ul><strong>Serves:</strong> 6+ servings</ul><br />

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>1 1/2 cups milk</ul>
                <ul>1 1/2 cups flour</ul>
                <ul>3/4 cup sugar</ul>
                <ul>1/3 cup butter, softened</ul>
                <ul>2 eggs</ul>
                
                <h3>Optional Add-Ins</h3>
                    <ul><strong>Chocolate chips:</strong> If you want your cake to have a hint of chocolate. 
                        Mini Reese's peanut butter cups are an add-on I love, but I only use add them 
                        when I'm in North America (they're way too expensive and hard to find in Brazil).</ul>
                    <ul><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> Add it to enhance your cake's smell and to help make 
                        your house smell like a bakery!</ul>
                    <ul><strong>Coconut:</strong> Coconut is a good idea if a simple milk cake is a bit 
                        too boring for you. Some shredded coconut in the batter and some on top can easily 
                        transform this dessert into a coconut cake.</ul>
                    <ul><strong>Condensed milk/dulce de leche:</strong> Pour a bit on top of your 
                        'bolo de leite' to decorate it when it's done baking. Designs/words/images 
                        are also possible if you're artistic.</ul>
